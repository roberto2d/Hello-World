# Hello-World
Hello, world! (getting baptized in code)
Ok, so, this Sign-In process is the longest I've done! But also, it's been a long road since I've started watching game development tutorials, wrote down my ideas, and yet haven't made the passing between wishing for and doing. I seek here guiding for making this passing. I am 27 now, my biggest interests are developing Offline Games for Android phones, Tvs and Android x86. I don't know much of mobile, since my previous Jam were an Unity learning experience, but this 2019 I commit to try cocos2d for it's open-source aspect aligns with my belief that knewledge is the only gift you can share and not have less than you had, so you lose nothing by dissiminating it or facilitating it's use, rather, you can be a positive change for doing so.
